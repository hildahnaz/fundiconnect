## *From Invisible to Invaluable: Revolutionizing Local Service Discovery*

---

### üéØ **THE CREATIVE CHALLENGE**

**Imagine this scenario:** Maria, a single mother in Nairobi, needs her washing machine fixed urgently. She's scrolling through endless Facebook groups, making countless phone calls, and getting no responses. Meanwhile, John, a skilled appliance repair fundi just 2km away, is sitting idle because nobody knows he exists.

**Your Mission:** Create the bridge that transforms this daily frustration into seamless connection and opportunity.

### üß© **THE PROBLEM UNIVERSE**

You're not just building a booking tool‚Äîyou're creating an **economic ecosystem** that solves multiple pain points:

**For Service Seekers:**
- Finding trusted providers feels like searching for a needle in a haystack
- No transparent pricing or availability information
- Payment disputes and no accountability measures
- Communication barriers and missed appointments

**For Service Providers (Fundis):**
- Limited visibility beyond word-of-mouth
- Inconsistent income due to poor client acquisition
- No professional credibility system
- Cash-only transactions limiting growth

**For Communities:**
- Local talent goes unrecognized
- Economic opportunities leak to big corporations
- No quality control or reputation systems

- **Supabase** for real-time data magic
