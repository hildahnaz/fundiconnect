### **TWITTER (Tech Community)**

#### **Thread 1: The Problem (Day -12)**
```
🧵 THREAD: Why Africa's $240B service sector is broken (and how to fix it)

1/8 Picture this: Your washing machine breaks on Friday night. 
You need clean clothes for Monday. You make 15 calls. Zero responses.

2/8 Meanwhile, Hassan, a skilled repair technician, sits 2km away 
with no customers. He's invisible to you. You're invisible to him.

3/8 This isn't a supply problem. Africa has millions of skilled fundis.
This is a DISCOVERY problem. And it's costing us billions.

4/8 73% of fundis struggle to find customers
68% of customers can't find trusted providers
Only 12% use digital platforms for service discovery

5/8 The opportunity? KES 240B annually. The solution? AI + Community.

6/8 What if your phone could:
🤖 Predict your service needs
🔍 Find verified providers instantly  
💳 Handle payments securely
🏘️ Build community trust

7/8 That's exactly what we're building. Fundi Connect turns 
everyday frustrations into extraordinary opportunities.

8/8 Live demo this Friday at Hackathon 2.0. 
RT if you want to see the future of local services! 🚀

#### **Tweet 2: AI Prediction Demo (Day -8)**
```
🤯 MIND = BLOWN

Our AI just predicted a customer's plumbing issue 3 days before 
it happened. Preventive maintenance scheduled. Crisis averted.

This is the power of predictive service discovery.
